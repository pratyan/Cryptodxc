This is a temporary documentation of the progress made so far:
1. There are color variables stored in index.css changing the variables changes the color according to user.
2. A prototype of Navbar has been created which will be modified in later meetings.
3. Hero section has been initialised and will start on it once we get a solid idea of what the design i supposed to be.
4. index.css also has button stylings which can be changed later.
5. pick a better name for the 'later' class in Navbar(make sure to make css changes as well).
